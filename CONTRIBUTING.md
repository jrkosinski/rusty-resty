## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rustapi.git
cd rustapi

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Code Style

We use `rustfmt` for code formatting and `clippy` for linting.

```bash
# Format your code
cargo fmt

# Run clippy
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

All code must pass `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy` before being merged.

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass with `cargo test`
- Add integration tests when appropriate
- Aim for high code coverage

### Commit Messages

- Use clear and meaningful commit messages
- Start with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add a detailed description if needed, separated by a blank line

Example:

```
Add user authentication endpoint

- Implement JWT token generation
- Add password hashing with bcrypt
- Include tests for auth flow
```
